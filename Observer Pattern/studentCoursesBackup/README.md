"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied
it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if
I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an

my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a

will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional
offense.

Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)
 For BST, the best case time complexity is O(log n) for search, insert and delete. Hence it is the best collection to store elements dynamically.
